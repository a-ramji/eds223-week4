# Week 4 

## Tuesday, October 24, 2023

## Spatial data models

-   vector data

    -   points, lines, polygons

        -   limitations

    -   discrete

-   raster data

    -   grid

        -   putting everything into little boxes

    -   continuous

## raster data models

geometry

-   cell size

-   number of rows/columns

-   cell origin

-   CRS

attribute

-   one value per cell

    -   categorical, numerical, logical

        -   examples: categorical( land cover (forest, grassland)), logical (true/false -- is it water?), numerical (avg temp)

        -   size of cell -- resolution

in vector data, for every row, we could have many columns

in raster, we only get one attribute per cell (one column)

-   ex, only PM 2.5

what do we do?

-   make a bunch of them

-   layers

-   grid cells are the same, values correspond to something different

-   "stack"

-   each raster is a layer

-   all in the same place = stack (we can stack them on top of each other)

-   placement matters

## spatial resolution

-   cell size --\> resolution

-   more cells = finer/higher res

-   fewer cells = coarser/lower res

## extent

## position

-   where cell origin is
